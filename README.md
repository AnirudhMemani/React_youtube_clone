# React Vite Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and includes a basic setup for a React application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

     ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-project.git
```cd react-vite-project```
```npm install```
Development
To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following command:
```npm run dev```
This will launch the development server and open your application in the browser. The server automatically reloads your code as you make changes.
Build
To build the project for production, use the following command:
```npm run build```
This creates an optimized and minified production-ready build in the dist directory.

Deployment
You can deploy the built files to a static hosting service of your choice. For example, you can deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.

Folder Structure
The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

public: Contains static assets that are directly copied to the build directory.
src: Contains the application's source code.
components: Contains reusable React components.
pages: Contains top-level components representing different pages.
App.js: The main component where you can define your routes and layout.
index.js: The entry point of the application.
Feel free to modify the folder structure to fit your specific needs.
